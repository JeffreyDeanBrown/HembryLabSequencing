# HembryLabSequencing
Scripts and documentation for sequencing analysis.

When the project was active, there was a google doc with notes and installation instructions.
This google doc is still active, but there is now also a markdown file on this github
with the information, located [here](https://github.com/JeffreyDeanBrown/HembryLabSequencing/blob/main/Sequencing%20Analysis%20v2.0.md)
